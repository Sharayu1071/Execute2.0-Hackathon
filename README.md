# :star2: Problem Statement

Being a business owner is great but at the same time to promote your business is more challenging as if you are doing good business and you are lacking the marketing and promotions skills then whatever you will make it will go in vain so to avoid this In present there is no one stop portal for all our marketing and promotions needs like if user wants to promote his/her business online/offline then it is difficult for him to get all the desired service at his fingertips under one roof like if user want to do the promotions in local city like example he/she wants to put his banner/hoardings then he/she have to contact the owner of that hoarding personally and then hoardings/banners will be put up but it is a time consuming process and this is just the one example of marketing and promotions and in that also it is very lengthy process so assume if user wants to do the promotions manually then it will be very time consuming so come up with the innovative solution so that this problem will be solved.

# :star: Proposed Solution

To solve the above the problem we are creating a one stop portal with the taste of machine learning in it  for all the marketing needs which will include all marketing domains which are essential for your brand promotions and establishments like 
Banners at particular area in the locality 
- Marketing people who visit door to door for promotions
- Youtube video social media marketing + ecommerce: ads 
- Seo for websites
- TV ads commercial 
- Email+ SMS ads
- Newspaper/magazine/print media ads

In which user will come to our portal and he/she will only select the service he/she wants from the above domain and rest everything is managed from our end like in the backend we will connect all the threads so that you will only deal with us and in the backend we will manage everything and by doing this your time will be saved,no need to reach out to people, all information will be secured with us and many more.
